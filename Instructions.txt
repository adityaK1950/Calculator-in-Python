Simple Calculator in Python
This calculator is created using a GUI built with Tkinter, a standard Graphical User Interface package for Python, included with most Python installations by default.

Checking Tkinter Installation
To verify if Tkinter is installed, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

python -m tkinter

If Tkinter is installed, a simple Tkinter window will open.

Installing Tkinter

If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it using the package manager associated with your Python installation.
Using pip:

pip install tk

Using conda:

conda install tk


Running the Calculator Code
Once Tkinter is installed, you can run the calculator code. If you've already installed Tkinter, you're ready to go! Simply execute the code.

Code Snippet:

import tkinter as tk
# Your calculator code goes here

This code sets up the Tkinter library for building graphical user interfaces in Python.
By following these steps, you'll have a functional Tkinter-based calculator. Happy coding!
